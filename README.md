"# GameTech" 

Greetings!

This repository contains the code that I submitted for my module in Advanced Game Technologies as part of the Computer Game Engineering master's at Newcastle University.
Feel free to have a browse!


All code is either written by me or was provided by Newcastle University as part of the course.
